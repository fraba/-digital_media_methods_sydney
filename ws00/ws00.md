## Why should I bother learning R?

*If you already know why you want to learn R (or you just blindly trust us), you might want to skip this section and start [installing R](#install-r).*

R is a programming language dedicated to statistical analysis and graphics. As all programming language is hard since must be understood unambiguously by a machine (as well as by the human being in charge of writing in the language). This means, that if you start today to learn it and if you have no other experience with other computer languages, it will take some effort to get the first results.

So, why you might want to invest time and effort in it?

The short answer is *data*. If you are working in the humanities or social sciences,

### OK, but what about RStudio?

## Install R

### For Windows

If you have a Windows computer, you need to download and install [this file](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-3.3.1-win.exe). 

### For Mac OS X

If you have a Mac, you need first to understand which version of OS X you have. You should be able to get it by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your screen and then on `About This Mac`.

# Getting started with R and RStudio

If you have successfully installed R and RStudio, have a look at this two video for a short introduction to R and RStudio. At the end you should be able to

* Open a code file, 
* Load data through the RStudio interface,
* Highlight a line in the code, 
* Execute highlighted lines by clicking

and be more or less familiar with the interface of RStudio

* where the code is,
* where is the console/output,
* where are the variables loaded in memory.
