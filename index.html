<h2>title: Repository for Digital media methods</h2>
<h1>Repository for Digital media methods (The University of Sydney)</h1>
<p><em>We will keep updating this repository, so keep coming back...</em></p>
<p>The first scheduled workshop is on 4 November 2016. In the workshop, we plan to use <em>R</em> and <em>RStudio</em> to analyse Twitter data.</p>
<ul>
<li>You find all the details on the workshop <a href="ws01/ws01.md">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We think it would be great if you could follow the workshop by replicating the analysis on your own laptop. To do so, you will need to previously install R and RStudio (which are free, as in 'free beer') and get some (very) basic familiarity with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>You find a short to guide to install and get started with R and RStudio <a href="ws00/ws00.md">here</a>.</li>
