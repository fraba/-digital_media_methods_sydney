<h1>Workshop #1: Introduction to R and RStudio</h1>
<p>4 November 2016 @ 12-2pm</p>
<p><em>We will keep updating this repository, so keep coming back...</em></p>
<h2>Background information</h2>
<p>For a context on the #smachedavo protest see <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-19/smashed-avocado-australian-cafes-offering-discounts/7945014">this</a>.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>During the workshop we plan to use this dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Twitter data scraped using a #smashedavo search from 14 October -  24 October is <a href="https://github.com/fraba/digital_media_methods_sydney/blob/master/ws01/data/twitter_data.csv">here</a>  (you don't need to download it, since you can load it directly into  R from the online repository).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>The code we plan to use in the workshop is <a href="https://github.com/fraba/digital_media_methods_sydney/raw/master/ws01/code/ws01_code.R">here</a>.</p>
<p>To execute the code with RStudio (to install see <a href="../ws00/ws00.html">here</a>) on your computer you need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Save the code (which is a simple text file ending with <code>.R</code>) to you  computer by downloading ans saving <a href="code/ws01_code.R">this file</a>;</li>
<li>Open RStudio; </li>
<li>In RStudio, open the file you just saved by <code>File</code> and then  <code>Open file</code>;</li>
</ol>
<p>The file with the code file should appear in one of the four panels (usually top-left). on your screen.</p>
<p>You will immediately note that the lines in the code file have two colors: light-gray and dark-gray. Lines that begin with a <code>#</code> are comments and are not actual lines of code. They are there to give you details on the code.</p>
IMPORTANT: To actually execute a line in the code file you need to
<ol>
<li>Place the cursors on the line (in the code file you just opened is line 4);</li>
<li>and click on the button <code>Run</code></li>.
</ol>
