# Workshop #1: Introduction to R and RStudio

4 November 2016 @ 12-2pm

*We will keep updating this repository, so keep coming back...*

## Background information

For a context on the #smachedavo protest see [this](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-19/smashed-avocado-australian-cafes-offering-discounts/7945014).

## Data

During the workshop we plan to use this dataset:

* Twitter data scraped using a #smashedavo search from 14 October - 24 October [here](https://github.com/fraba/digital_media_methods_sydney/blob/master/ws01/data/twitter_data.csv) (you don't need to download it, since you can load it directly into R from the online repository).

## Code

The code we plan to use in the workshop is [here](code/ws01_code.R).

To execute the code with RStudio (to install see [here]()) on your computer you need to

1. Save the code (which is a simple text file ending with `.R`) to you computer by
..1. open [this link](https://github.com/fraba/digital_media_methods_sydney/raw/master/ws01/code/ws01_code.R) in your browser;
..2. save the file from your browser (it is usually by `File` and `Save as...` or `Save page as...`);
2. Open RStudio;
3. In RStudio, open the file you just saved by `File` and then `Open file`;

The file with the code file should appear in one of the four panels (usually top-left). on your screen. You will immediately note that the lines in the code file have two colors: light-gray and dark-gray. Lines that begin with a `#` are comments and are not actual lines of code. They are there to give you details on the code.

IMPORTANT: To actually execute a line in the code file you need to

4. Place the cursors on the line (in the code file you just opened is line 4) and click on the button
