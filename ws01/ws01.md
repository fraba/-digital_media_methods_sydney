Workshop \#1: Introduction to R and RStudio
===========================================

4 November 2016 @ 12-2pm

*We will keep updating this repository, so keep coming back...*

Background information
----------------------

For a context on the \#smachedavo protest see\
[this](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-19/smashed-avocado-australian-cafes-offering-discounts/7945014).

Data
----

During the workshop we plan to use this dataset:

-   Twitter data scraped using a \#smashedavo search from 14 October -\
     24 October\

    [here](https://github.com/fraba/digital_media_methods_sydney/blob/master/ws01/data/twitter_data.csv)\
     (you don't need to download it, since you can load it directly
    into\
     R from the online repository).

Code
----

The code we plan to use in the workshop is [here](code/ws01_code.R).

To execute the code with RStudio (to install see [here]()) on your\
computer you need to

1.  Save the code (which is a simple text file ending with `.R`) to you\
     computer by\\\
     ..1. open [this\

    link](https://github.com/fraba/digital_media_methods_sydney/raw/master/ws01/code/ws01_code.R)\
     in your browser;\\\
     ..2. save the file from your browser (it is usually by `File` and\
     `Save as...` or `Save page as...`);\\\
2.  Open RStudio;\\\
3.  In RStudio, open the file you just saved by `File` and then\
     `Open file`;

The file with the code file should appear in one of the four panels\
(usually top-left). on your screen. You will immediately note that the\
lines in the code file have two colors: light-gray and dark-gray. Lines\
that begin with a `#` are comments and are not actual lines of code.\
They are there to give you details on the code.

IMPORTANT: To actually execute a line in the code file you need to

1.  Place the cursors on the line (in the code file you just opened is\
     line 4) and click on the button `Run`.
