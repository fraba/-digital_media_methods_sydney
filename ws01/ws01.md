# Workshop #1: Introduction to R and RStudio

4 November 2016 @ 12-2pm

*We will keep updating this repository, so keep coming back...*

## Background information

For a context on the #smachedavo protest see [this](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-19/smashed-avocado-australian-cafes-offering-discounts/7945014).

## Data

During the workshop we plan to use this dataset:

* Twitter data scraped using a #smashedavo search from 14 October - 24 October [here](https://github.com/fraba/digital_media_methods_sydney/blob/master/ws01/data/twitter_data.csv) (you don't need to download it, since you can load it directly into R from the online repository).

## Code

The code we plan to use in the workshop is [here](https://github.com/fraba/digital_media_methods_sydney/blob/master/ws01/ws01_code.R).
