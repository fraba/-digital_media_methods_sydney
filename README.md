# Repository for Digital media methods (The University of Sydney)

*We will keep updating this repository, so keep coming back...*

The first scheduled workshop is on 4 November 2016. In the workshop, we plan to use *R* and *RStudio* to analyse Twitter data.

* You find all the details on the workshop [here](../ws01/ws01.md).

We think it would be great if you could follow the workshop by replicating the analysis on your own laptop. To do so, you will need to previously install R and RStudio (which are free, as in 'free beer') and get some (very) basic familiarity with them.

* You find a short to guide to install and get started with R and RStudio [here](../ws00/ws00.md).
